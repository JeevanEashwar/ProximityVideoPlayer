# ProximityVideoPlayer
Cast your videos using third party casting SDKs

## TODO:
1. Register yourself with Google Cast SDK and use the same app Id in the project's Info section
2 a. If you want to use a video from remote you can change the `videoURL` in the `ProximityVideoPlayer/ProximityVideoPlayer/CastPlayerView/CastPlayerViewModal.swift` file
2 b. If want to read a media file locally from the Project, add your .mp4 file to `ProximityVideoPlayer/Videos` folder and use the same name in the `Constants.VideoFile.Name`
